Agent,"Lira, we need to clarify something. While reviewing your belongings, we noticed a used bus ticket for a return trip from Drenas to Prishtina, dated on September 29th. You previously said you didn't travel that day. Can you explain this?"
Comment,visibly nervous
Lira,"I I didn't mean to lie. I just I didn't want to miss work, even though I wasn't feeling great. I had to go to the beauty salon in Prishtina to meet with clients."
Agent,"So you went to work at the beauty salon on the 29th, even though you were unwell?"
Comment,sighs
Lira,"Yes. I know it wasn't the right thing to do, but I couldn't afford to miss a day. I rely on that job to pay for my studies. If my boss finds out I worked while I was sick, they'll fire me. Please don't tell them. I don't have any other way to support myself."
Agent,"Lira, we're not here to harm you, but withholding the truth complicates the investigation. Do you recall interacting with anyone at the salon who might have been unwell or unusual?"
Lira,"Not really. I had to meet my best client Rina. But they all seemed fine, although I wasn't paying much attention I just wanted to get through the day and go home."
Agent,Where do you work Lira?
Lira ,"Please do not tell my boss. I work at the 'Pink Nails' beauty salon."
Agent,Thank you for coming clean.
Hint,"**Discard: 11**"
