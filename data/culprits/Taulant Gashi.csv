Agent,"Taulant, thank you for meeting with us. We’re concerned about your illness following your journey to Drenas on the 28th. Can you start by telling us when you first noticed symptoms?"
Taulant,"It was late on the night of the 29th. At first, I thought it was just exhaustion—I’d been overworking myself. But it hit me harder than I expected."
Agent,What kind of symptoms did you experience?
Taulant,"Extreme headache, fever and muscle pain. It felt different from anything I’ve had before."
Agent,Did you come into close contact with anyone after your trip to Drenas?
Taulant,"No, I didn’t. I’ve mostly been keeping to myself. I didn’t meet with family or friends after returning."
Agent,Let’s go back to your journey. Can you recall who else was on the bus?
Comment,Shrugs
Taulant,"Not really. I wasn’t paying much attention. There was a woman—old woman, I think—sitting closer to the front."
Agent,Witnesses said you were wearing a lab coat during the trip. Is that typical for you?
Comment,shifts uncomfortably
Taulant,I guess I forgot to change before leaving the lab. It’s not that unusual.
Agent,"They also said you seemed distracted, like something was on your mind. What was bothering you?"
Comment,shrugs it off
Taulant,Just research deadlines. You know how it is.
Agent,Can you tell us more about your work?
Taulant,I’m part of a project of cooperation between the Biology & Chemistry Faculty in Prishtina. We’re focusing on experimental compounds.
Agent,What kind of compounds are you working on? Are they related to viruses or disease prevention?
Comment,hesitates
Taulant,It’s mainly theoretical work—just testing new ideas. Some of it involves creating stable solutions for potential antiviral applications.
Agent,"Stable solutions? That sounds significant. Have your experiments shown anything unusual recently?
"
Comment,visibly uncomfortable
Taulant,Nothing worth noting. You’d have to check the lab records if you’re curious.
Agent,Is it common for you to travel in the middle of a project?
Taulant,"I needed a break. I’ve been putting in long hours, and Drenas felt like a good place to clear my head."
Agent,"Thank you, Taulant. If we have more questions, we’ll reach out. Please remain available."
Taulant,"Sure, no problem."
