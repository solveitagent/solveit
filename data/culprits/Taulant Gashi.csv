Agent,"Taulant, thank you for meeting with us. We're concerned about your illness following your journey to Drenas on the 28th. Can you start by telling us when you first noticed symptoms?"
Taulant,"It was late on the night of the 29th. At first, I thought it was just exhaustion I'd been overworking myself. But it hit me harder than I expected."
Agent,What kind of symptoms did you experience?
Taulant,"Extreme headache, fever and muscle pain. It felt different from anything I've had before."
Agent,Did you come into close contact with anyone after your trip to Drenas?
Taulant,"No, I didn't. I've mostly been keeping to myself. I didn't meet with family or friends after returning."
Agent,Let's go back to your journey. Can you recall who else was on the bus?
Comment,Shrugs
Taulant,"Not really. I wasn't paying much attention. There was a woman old woman, I think sitting closer to the front."
Agent,Witnesses said you were wearing a lab coat during the trip. Is that typical for you?
Comment,shifts uncomfortably
Taulant,I guess I forgot to change before leaving the lab. It's not that unusual.
Agent,"They also said you seemed distracted, like something was on your mind. What was bothering you?"
Comment,shrugs it off
Taulant,Just research deadlines. You know how it is.
Agent,Can you tell us more about your work?
Taulant,I'm part of a project of cooperation between the Biology & Chemistry Faculty in Prishtina. We're focusing on experimental compounds.
Agent,What kind of compounds are you working on? Are they related to viruses or disease prevention?
Taulant,We're actually in an exciting phase we are researching to develop a vaccine using advanced AI. The system analyzed thousands of viral protein structures and genetic sequences to help us pinpoint the most effective formulation.
Agent,"That sounds significant. Have your experiments shown anything unusual recently?"
Taulant,"Yes, our recent trials, both in cell cultures and animal models, have shown strong immune responses. The AI not only accelerated our research but also ensured the vaccine's stability and effectiveness. The lab records provide all the detailed results. You'd have to check the lab records if you're curious."
Agent,"I see. And I noticed you took some time off recently do you often step away mid-project?"
Taulant,"I needed a break. I've been putting in long hours, and going back to my hometown Drenas felt like a good place to clear my head."
Agent,"Thank you, Taulant. If we have more questions, we'll reach out. Please remain available."
Taulant,"Absolutely, I'm here to provide any additional details you need."
