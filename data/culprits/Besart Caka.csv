Agent,"Thank you for taking the time to speak with us, Mr. Caka. I know you’re not feeling well. Can you tell us where you were working before you became ill?"
Comment,"lying in bed, clearly irritated"
Besart,"I work at a law firm here in Prishtina—Judex. Sometimes I meet with clients wherever they are. Now, can we make this quick? I don’t have time for this."
Agent,Of course. When did you first start feeling unwell?
Besart,"On October 1st. It started with a sore throat, and by the next day, I was feeling completely drained."
Agent,Where were you in the days leading up to your illness?
Besart,I had a couple of meetings. One was with a client in Drenas. It was nothing out of the ordinary. We discussed… business.
Agent,Do you recall anything unusual about the client?
Comment,hesitates briefly
Besart,"They seemed distracted, a bit off. But I didn’t pry—it’s not my job to get involved in their personal matters."
Agent,What line of work was this client in?
Comment,"pauses, choosing his words carefully"
Besart,"Research. They work in research. Specifically on viruses, I believe."
Agent,Research on viruses? That’s quite specific. Did you know them well?
Besart,"Not personally. It was a professional consultation. I offer advice on patents and intellectual property, and that’s all I’ll say about it."
Agent,Did this client mention any concerns or frustrations?
Comment,looks annoye
Besart,"They seemed frustrated with their work, sure. Something about… not getting the credit they felt they deserved. Look, I don’t want to discuss my clients. Can we move on?"
Agent,Did you have any close contact with family or colleagues after meeting with this client?
Besart,"My parents live nearby, and I’ve seen them recently. They’re not feeling great, either. That’s why I’m trying to limit contact now."
Agent,"Thank you, Mr. Caka. One last question—how long have you been consulting with this particular client?"
Comment,shifts uncomfortably
Besart,"A while. They’ve been exploring their options, trying to figure out the best way to move forward with their work."
Agent,Understood. Can you give us their name?
Besart,I would not like too.
Agent,We appreciate your cooperation and hope you feel better soon.
Comment,waves dismissively
Besart,Fine. Just don’t take up more of my time.
