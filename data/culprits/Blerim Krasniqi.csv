Agent,"Thank you for speaking with us, Blerim. Let's start with the basics. When did you first notice symptoms?"
Blerim,"It was October 1st. I had a headache and a sore throat. I didn't think much of it at first'it felt like a regular cold."
Agent,Where were you in the days leading up to your illness?
Blerim,I usually stick to a routine. I went to the local market and the gym in Prishtina.
Agent,Did you notice anything unusual at either location?
Blerim,"Not really. The market was its usual busy self, and the gym was crowded, as always. Nothing stood out to me."
Agent,Did you have any contact with people who seemed unwell?
Blerim,"No, not that I can recall. Most people were just focused on their workouts at the gym."
Agent,"So, nothing unusual?"
Blerim,"Well, actually earlier, I slipped a letter into Rina's bag. It was our little secret blend of fitness, history, and a promise."
Agent,A letter? For what?
Blerim,"Well Rina is into detective games. So I was trying to send not just a clue to the gym's hidden corner; more like a  reminder of our shared journey at the gym."
Agent,Looks like love and mystery are working out hand in hand here.
Blerim,You could say that. Rina and I always find our way.
Agent,Tell us about yourself. What do you do?
Blerim,"I'm a journalism student, and I work for Koha Ditore. It's a lot to balance, but I enjoy it. Lately, I've been investigating a break-in that occurred on September 28, 2024, at the University of Prishtina."
Agent,And what did you find out from your search?
Blerim,"The investigation is still ongoing from the police, but check out my article."
Agent,"Do you live alone, or did anyone in your household fall ill after you?"
Blerim,"I live alone here in Prishtina, so I didn't have much interaction with anyone at home."
Comment,pauses briefly
Agent,Did you meet with anyone socially after your gym visit?
Blerim,"No, not really. I just went about my day as usual."
Agent,"Blerim, you mentioned the gym earlier. Where do you usually go? Also, were you there alone?"
Comment,fidgets slightly
Blerim,"Yes, I usually do. I go to Fivestar Fitness Grand Hotel Gym. It's my time to focus and clear my head."
Agent,"Thank you, Blerim. If we need further clarification, we'll reach out."
Blerim,"Sure, no problem."
