Agent,"Hello, Lira. We appreciate your time. We're speaking with passengers from the bus drive to Drenas on September 28th to better understand this outbreak. Can you tell us when you first started feeling unwell?"
Lira,"Sure. I first noticed symptoms on the 29th just a terrible headache. I normally don't get sick, so it really threw me off."
Agent,Who else was on the bus that night? Do you remember anyone in particular?
Lira,"Let me think... There was a woman, probably in her late 50s, with a unique style. Then there was the bus driver, of course. And there was another guy who seemed out of breath and distracted. No one seemed sick, though I didn't hear anyone coughing."
Agent,Understood. Are you in Prishtina daily? Could you tell us a bit about what you do there?
Lira,"Yes, I work at a beauty salon in Prishtina and study to become a teacher. It keeps me busy, going back and forth each day."
Agent,So you're studying. Do you happen to know a student named Lea Pula?
Comment,"hesitates, thinking for a moment"
Lira ,"No I don't think so."
Comment,"shows her the ID card with Lea Pula's picture"
Agent,"Take a look at this. Do you recognize this person, either from the bus or the station that day?"
Comment,studies the card briefly
Lira ,"I don't recall seeing her. But she does look like she's wearing a lab coat, similar to what that other guy on the bus was wearing."
Agent,Did you notice anything else about her or the guy in the lab coat?
Lira,"No, not really. I wasn't paying much attention I just wanted to get home."
Agent,Did you travel to Prishtina for work on the 29th?
Lira,"No, because of the headache... I mean... I couldn't finish my shift."
Agent,So you did not travel to Prishtina on the 29th?
Comment,"distressed, continues "
Lira,No
Agent,"Lira, can I ask about your living situation? Do you live alone or with family?"
Lira,I live with my family.
Agent,Have any of them shown symptoms or felt unwell?
Lira ,"No, they all seem fine. I was staying in my room mostly, trying not to bother anyone. Now I do not know since I have been admitted to the hospital."
Agent,That's good to hear. Have you had close contact with them since you started feeling unwell?
Lira,Not really. I've been keeping to myself to make sure they stay healthy.
Agent,"Thank you, Lira. We appreciate your help. We'll be looking further into this. Hope you recover soon."
