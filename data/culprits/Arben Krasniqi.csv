Agent,"Hello, Arben. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. Can you tell us when you first started feeling unwell?"
Arben,Sure. It was October 3rd. I had a fever and a sore throat. I figured it was just the weather changing—it’s happened before.
Agent,Where do you think you might have taken the illness?
Arben,"Well, I use public transportation a lot. I was at the bus station in Lipjan and later went to the market in Prishtina. Both places were crowded. It could’ve been anywhere, honestly."
Agent,Did you have close contact with anyone during that time?
Comment,pauses
Arben,"I did buy groceries at the market. The cashier coughed a couple of times, but who knows?"
Agent,Did you risk anyone else by being around them while feeling unwell?
Arben,"I hope not. I live with my younger brother, but I stayed in my room once I realized I wasn’t feeling well. He’s also a bit sick now, so I guess I also helped to spread it."
Agent,Do you work?
Comment,smiles slightly
Arben,"I’m a cook at a small café. My dream is to one day open my own restaurant. It’s nothing fancy, just a place where people feel at home. Cooking has always been my way of expressing joy. "
Agent,"Thank you, Arben. "
