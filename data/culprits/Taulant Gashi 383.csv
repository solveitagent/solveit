Agent,"Taulant, thank you for meeting with us again. We’ve been following up on some details and have a few questions. Do you know a student named Lea Pula?"
Comment,hesitates
Taulant,Yes… I know Lea. Why do you ask?
Agent,Witnesses say you were wearing a lab coat on the bus. Were you working together in the lab that day?
Comment,visibly uncomfortable
Taulant,No. Lea wasn’t on the bus with me.
Comment,You show Lea’s ID card
Agent,Then how do you explain this? Her Chemistry Lab ID was found on the bus to Drenas.
Comment,"staring at the ID, visibly shocked"
Taulant,That’s… impossible. She wasn’t with me.
Agent,So how do you think her ID card ended up there?
Comment,stammers
Taulant," I don’t know. Maybe she dropped it somewhere, or someone else had it?"
Agent,What exactly were you working on in the lab?
Comment,"hesitates, avoiding eye contact"
Taulant,We were developing a vaccine… for a virus.
Agent,A virus? What’s it called?
Taulant,We named it the Nexora Virus.
Agent,Can you describe it?
Comment,pauses
Taulant,"It’s a virus with symptoms like fever, headache, and muscle pain."
Agent,How does it spread?
Comment,carefully responds
Taulant,"From what we’ve studied, it’s contact-based. Surfaces, physical interaction—not airborne."
Agent,And the vaccine you were working on?
Taulant,We called it N-Serum. It was designed to counter the virus if it ever became an issue.
Agent,"Taulant, the symptoms you experienced on the 29th match what you’ve just described. Don’t you find that suspicious?"
Comment,defensively 
Taulant,Those are general symptoms. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions or cause panic.
Agent,Did you speak with Lea after the 28th?
Taulant,"No, the last time I spoke with her, she called me to say the police were at the lab."
Agent,Police? Why were they there?
Taulant,"I don’t know. She didn’t explain much, just said they were investigating something."
Agent,"If there’s more you know about this virus or your work in the lab, you need to share it now."
Comment,sighs heavily 
Taulant,That’s all I know. I’ve told you everything.
