Agent,"Thank you, Professor Kelmendi, for meeting with us today. We’re hoping you can provide some insight into the research happening here and the students involved."
Professor Kelmendi,"Of course. Our research team has been doing incredible work, and this collaboration is a huge milestone—not just for our department but for the entire university. Bringing together the Chemistry and Biology faculties is the first of its kind here in Kosova, and it’s already showing how much we can achieve when we pool our strengths."
Agent,That’s very inspiring. How do you think this research impacts Kosova?
Professor Kelmendi,"Tremendously. This kind of groundbreaking work puts Kosova on the map for scientific innovation. With results like these, we’re attracting interest and funding for more advanced research projects. It’s not just about academia—it’s about building a future where Kosova becomes a leader in scientific discovery."
Agent,Can you tell us more about the team working on this project?
Professor Kelmendi,"Absolutely. Taulant and Lea are outstanding students. Taulant has this drive, a competitive edge that pushes him to excel, but he’s very much an individualist. On the other hand, Lea is the moral compass of the group, always ensuring that ethical guidelines are followed. She’s also incredibly dedicated to her work with chemical compounds—almost to the point of obsession. I often chuckle about it because her passion is so evident. Together, they’ve enriched the team in ways I didn’t think possible."
Agent,That’s wonderful to hear. What can you tell us about the compound you’re researching?
Professor Kelmendi,"Our work involves creating a vaccine N-Serum. Of course, we follow all safety procedures rigorously. However, I can’t deny that the symptoms we’re seeing in this outbreak are early similar to the virus we’ve been studying. That’s concerning. We need to analyze this further to see if there’s any connection."
Agent,Do you think there’s any risk of an accidental spread?
Professor Kelmendi,"I truly hope not. We have strict protocols in place. But science is unpredictable, and I won’t dismiss the need for further investigation."
Agent,Thank you for your honesty. Is there anything else about Taulant and Lea that stands out to you?
Professor Kelmendi,"Their dynamic, really. Taulant’s drive to push limits paired with Lea’s conscientious nature makes for a productive balance. That said, they’ve had some disagreements—nothing out of the ordinary, but their differing perspectives occasionally clash."
Agent,"Interesting. We might need to speak to them further. Thank you for your time, Professor Kelmendi."
Professor Kelmendi,"You’re welcome. I hope this helps your investigation. If there’s anything else you need, let me know."
