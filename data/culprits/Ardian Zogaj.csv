Agent,"Inspector Zogaj, thank you for taking the time to speak with us. We’re revisiting the break-in case at the Biology & Chemistry Lab of the University of Prishtina, as it might be linked to the virus outbreak. Can you tell us what you recall about the investigation?"
Inspector Zogaj,"The break-in? Yes, I remember it. Ms. Lea Pula reported it, claiming she arrived at the lab and found the door ajar. She said she saw someone running out—a male, wearing a lab coat."
Agent,And the entry logs?
Inspector Zogaj,"Taulant Gashi’s entries matched perfectly with his account—entered in the morning, left in the afternoon. Lea’s, however, did not. She claimed she entered at 18:40, but the logs show her entry at 18:15. When confronted, she gave some excuse about losing her ID card, which we couldn’t confirm."
Agent,Was there anything missing from the lab?
Inspector Zogaj,"No. That’s the frustrating part. Nothing was reported stolen. There were signs of tampering near the N-Serum container, but it was still there. With the virus outbreak demanding our attention, we had to deprioritize the case."
Agent,"Inspector, we have reason to believe that this break-in might be directly connected to the outbreak."
Comment,"pauses, surprised"
Inspector Zogaj,Connected to the outbreak? That’s quite a leap.
Agent,"We’re following leads that suggest a possible link. We’re on it, but this case needs renewed attention."
Comment,sighs
Inspector Zogaj,"If that’s true, then it’s much bigger than we thought. I’ll support your team however I can. Let me know what you need."
Agent,"Thank you, Inspector. We’ll be in touch."
