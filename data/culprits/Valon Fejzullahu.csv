Agent,"Valon, thank you for speaking with us. Can you tell us when you first started experiencing symptoms?"
Valon,October 3rd. It hit me like a truck—headache and nausea. I couldn’t even finish my workout.
Agent,Where do you think you might have gotten sick?
Valon,Probably the gym in Lipjan. I go there almost every day. I noticed someone left the equipment sweaty and didn’t wipe it down. That could’ve been it.
Agent,Did you risk anyone else by being around them while feeling unwell?
Valon,"I might, you never know. "
Agent ,Have you heard of anyone else experiencing similar symptoms recently?
Valon,"Yes, one of my friends, Besart Caka, a well-known lawyer, is also sick. He mentioned feeling unwell a few days before me. "
Agent,Tell us a bit about yourself.

Valon,"I’m a fitness instructor. I love helping people get stronger—not just physically, but mentally too. My dream is to open a gym that’s more affordable for everyone. Fitness should be for everyone, not just the rich."
Agent,"Thank you, Valon. We appreciate your cooperation."
