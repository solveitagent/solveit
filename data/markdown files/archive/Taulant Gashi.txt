**Inspector Zogaj:** Mr. Gashi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I need to clarify a few things regarding todayâ€™s events at the Biology & Chemistry Lab.  

**Taulant:** Sure, Inspector. Iâ€™m not sure how I can help, but go ahead.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** The access logs show that you entered the lab earlier today. Can you confirm what time you were there?  

**Taulant:** Yes, I was there in the morning. I think I left around 14:00.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you see or meet with Ms. Lea Pula while you were at the lab?  

**Taulant:** No, I didnâ€™t. We didnâ€™t cross paths today.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you meet or notice anyone suspicious during your time there?  

**Taulant:** No, it was just the usualâ€”quiet. I didnâ€™t see anything unusual.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you have any contact with Ms. Pula at all today?  

**Taulant:** She called me this evening, saying something about the police being at the lab. I told her I didnâ€™t know anything and ended the call.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Were there any issues between you and Ms. Pula recently? Any conflicts?  

**Taulant:** Conflicts? No, not really. But she can be a bit... paranoid at times.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Paranoid? Care to explain?  

**Taulant:** She sometimes misplaces things, and then assumes somethingâ€™s wrong or someoneâ€™s trying to sabotage her. Itâ€™s a bit much, to be honest.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** And what did you do after leaving the lab today?  

**Taulant:** I left for Drenas shortly after. I needed to take some time away from the stress of research.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Gashi. If I have further questions, Iâ€™ll reach out again.  

**Taulant:** Of course. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything else you need.
