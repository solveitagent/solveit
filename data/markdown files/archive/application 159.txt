**Application for ID Card Replacement**


**Date**: September 29, 2024

**To**: University Administration Office

**From**: Lea Pula

**Student ID Number**: 0001565

**Subject**: Request for Replacement ID Card


Dear Administration Office,


I am writing to formally request a replacement for my student ID card, which I believe has been lost. I last used the card on September 27, 2024, and discovered it was missing the following day. 
Despite thoroughly searching my personal belongings and frequently visited locations, I have been unable to locate it.
The card is essential for my academic activities, as it provides access to the Biology and Chemistry Lab and other university facilities critical for my ongoing research.
I kindly request that a replacement ID card be issued at your earliest convenience. I am willing to provide any necessary documentation or pay any applicable fees to facilitate the process.


Thank you for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me if further information is required.


Sincerely,

Lea Pula
