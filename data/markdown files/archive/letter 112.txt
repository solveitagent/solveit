Dear Taulant,

I’ve thought long and hard about your proposal, and I need to be honest—I cannot support it. What you’re suggesting goes against everything I believe in. Science isn’t meant to be twisted into a tool for personal profit, especially not at the cost of its integrity. Our discovery has the potential to save lives, not become a commodity for the highest bidder.

I know you’ve worked incredibly hard on this project—so have I. That’s why I believe we both deserve an equal say in what happens next. This isn’t just your achievement, Taulant. It’s ours.

You may think wealth is the ultimate measure of success, but I disagree. True success lies in what we contribute to the world, not what we take from it. By standing firm in our ethics, we have a chance to become the kind of scientists who inspire others, not ones who compromise their principles for fleeting gains.

I respect your dedication and intelligence, but I can’t align myself with this path. I hope you’ll reconsider. What we’ve created deserves better than to be sold off like a product. We have the chance to make a real difference. Let’s not waste it.

Ps: I would like to emphasize that we do not need to consult any lawyer for me to know that I am right. I am not willing to meet with your lawyer regarding this matter.
