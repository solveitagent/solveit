**Subject**: Non-Operational CCTV at Biology & Chemistry Faculty

**Summary**:

The CCTV system at the Faculty of the University of Prishtina has been non-operational for over a week, including the night of the reported break-in on **September 28th, 2024**.

**Details**:

- The security guard, interviewed as part of the investigation, confirmed the malfunction and stated that they are aware of the issue.
- Repairs are delayed due to scheduling constraints with the maintenance company.
- The guard also noted that, on weekends, the faculty is usually quiet, with only students present.
- No formal access controls are in place; the building is open to all students and visitors during operational hours.

This lack of monitoring and access control has left the premises vulnerable, complicating the investigation further.
