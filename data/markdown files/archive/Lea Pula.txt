**Inspector Zogaj:** Ms. Pula, thank you for coming in. Let’s get straight to the point. You’re here because we need answers about the break-in at the Biology & Chemistry Lab. Start from the beginning—what happened when you arrived?  

**Lea:** I understand. I got to the lab at around 18:40. The door was open, which was strange. When I walked in, I felt someone behind me. I turned, and that’s when I saw someone running out.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Someone? Be specific. What did you see?  

**Lea:** It was hard to tell. They were wearing a lab coat. I couldn’t see their face, only their back as they ran away.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Surely you observed something useful. Was this person male, female? Tall, short?  

**Lea:** He was definitely male. He was wearing a hood.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** What did you do after you saw him?  

**Lea:** I tried to follow him, but they were too fast. I called the police immediately after I couldn’t catch up.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Let’s backtrack. You say the door was open when you arrived. Did it look forced—damaged in any way?  

**Lea:** No, it wasn’t damaged. Just open.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Open doors don’t just happen, Ms. Pula. Are you sure you didn’t leave it open yourself earlier in the day?  

**Lea:** No, I didn’t leave it open. I didn’t even enter the lab earlier—I was looking for my ID card.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** So you came back in the evening for an ID card. Why not check during regular hours?  

**Lea:** I couldn’t find it earlier and thought I might have left it in my locker.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** The access logs show you as the last recorded entry at 18:15, not 18:40. Care to explain?  

**Lea:** That is not true. I only came by the lab at 18:40. I remember it well because I was rushing to catch my bus back home at 19:15. Someone else must have used my card. I never found it that evening.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you share your card with anyone?  

**Lea:** Absolutely not. I never share my card. Why would I?  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Let’s talk about the lab itself. Did you notice anything out of place—anything at all?  

**Lea:** Not initially. But now that you ask, the container holding the N-Serum was slightly ajar.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** N-Serum. That’s critical material, isn’t it?  

**Lea:** Yes. That is why I closed it.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Ms. Pula, what are you currently working on in the lab?  

**Lea:** We’re researching a vaccine prototype for a virus as part of our academic project.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** And who is “we”?  

**Lea:** Myself and Taulant Gashi.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Do you know Taulant well?  

**Lea:** Yes. We’ve been working together for a while.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** He’s a biology student, and you’re in chemistry. What exactly are you working on together?  

**Lea:** His expertise in virology complements my work in chemical analysis. We’re collaborating to refine the vaccine formula.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you meet with Taulant today?  

**Lea:** No, I didn’t. We usually communicate during lab hours or via messages.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Did you have contact with Taulant Gashi today?  

**Lea:** Yes, I called him to ask if he forgot to close the N-Serum.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** And what did Taulant say?  

**Lea:** No, he said he didn’t. He got very defensive.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** And have you had trouble working together lately?  

**Lea:** Not really, but we do not agree on one major point—a matter of principle—whether or not to sell our discovery.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Do you have someone who can confirm that you came to the lab at 18:40?  

**Lea:** No, not really. Do I need to?!  

**Inspector Zogaj:** And your ID card—was it in the lab?  

**Lea:** No, I did not find it.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Faculty staff and PhD students have access to the lab. Are you certain none of your colleagues could have used your card?  

**Lea:** I don’t know. It’s possible someone found it and used it without my knowledge.  

**Inspector Zogaj:** Thank you, Ms. Pula. If you recall anything else, we’ll need you to inform us immediately.  

**Lea:** I’ll cooperate fully.
