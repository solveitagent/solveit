# Lea's locker opens!

With a satisfying click, the locker opens, revealing its contents. Inside, you find a collection of neatly organized notes, a small vial labeled **"H₂O Compound,"** and a curious bookmark referencing Helium from the periodic table. You chuckle—she truly is obsessed with chemical compounds.  

**Take a closer look! Well done, team!**
